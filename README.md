# ABC Insurance Assistant

## Introduction
This is a version zero insurance focused chatbot designed to demonstrate some of the functionality of the Rasa 
conversational AI platform.

The ABC Insurance Assistant has two existing customers in memory. 
* Jane Brown, whose policy number is 99999999 and has a claim registered against claim id AB1234.
* John Brown, whose policy number is 11111111 and has a claim registered against claim id AB4321.

The current stage of development is limited and not much has been done to prevent the bot becoming confused.  
It should however be able to follow predefined tasks such as issuing a new business quote or retrieve the status of a claim.

When the bot is activated it will require a greeting such as "Hello" for it to come to life.  If at any point 
in the conversational journey you want to reset the bot issue another greeting.
